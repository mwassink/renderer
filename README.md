This is a 3D renderer. Now, it does basic rendering of models along with some other things. It contains a demo to test models, which are not included in the source.
I am writing it to learn and use in a game.

It uses OpenGL 4.5, the C runtime library, and some platform specific functions for Windows.

Cool Features:
- Normal Mapping
- Spotlight Shadows
- Bounding Spheres (frustum culling)
  - Visible through ray tracing compute shader
- Skyboxes
