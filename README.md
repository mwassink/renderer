This is a 3D renderer I am working on. Now, it does basic rendering of models along with some other things. It has issues. It contains a demo to test models, which are not included in the source.
I am writing it to
1) implement and learn 3D geometry and some linear algebra
2) explore and implement rendering and acceleration techiniques learned in Real-Time Rendering 4 and Foundations of Game Engine Development 2
3) Potentially use in a simple game

It uses OpenGL 4.5, a little of the C runtime library, and some platform stuff for Win32.
