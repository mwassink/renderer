- Add extra shadow shader for non-textured stuff
- Performance seems to become awful after a while
Other: 
- bounding boxes, acceleration algorithms
- Skyboxes
- Cube shadow map
- Cascading shadow maps
- Visible lights
- SSAO
- Better BRDF... fresnel mirrors? masking? normal dist. function? (GGX?)
- environment mapping
- light extent optimization
